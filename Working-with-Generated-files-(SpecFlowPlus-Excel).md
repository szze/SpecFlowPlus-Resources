The SpecFlow+ Excel NuGet package configures the project to use the build-time generation feature of SpecFlow by adding an MsBuild target to the project file. This ensures that the tests from the Excel files are re-generated when necessary. The build-time generation works well together with the normal generation process that is triggered by saving the feature files from Visual Studio. A positive side-effect of this is, that you no longer need to put the generated files to source control! You can configure your source control system to ignore the following patterns (e.g. by adding these lines to `.gitignore`):

* `*.feature.cs`
* `*.feature.xlsx.*`

_Note:_ The current version of SpecFlow+ Excel uses an updated version of the [SpecFlow MsBuild integration](http://www.specflow.org/documentation/Generate-Tests-from-MsBuild/). This updated version is included to the `SpecFlow.Plus.Excel` NuGet package and it configures the project to use this updated version. If you have already enabled build-time generation with SpecFlow earlier, please update the referenced target file to point to the one from this package.
