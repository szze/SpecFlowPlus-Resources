Gherkin scenarios often use tables to store a series of test values that are referenced using placeholders in the Gherkin steps. You can see the placholder (“&lt;project template”>) and a table containing the possible values of the placeholder in the following screenshot:

Use the preview check box in the first column to substitute the placeholders with the values in the corresponding row in the table:
