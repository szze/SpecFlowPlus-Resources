The following are known issues with SpecFlow+, and are scheduled to be fixed:

* "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" when using NUnit's Assert command in conjunction with NUnit tests executed with SpecFlow+ Runner.   
  **Note:** This issue is **fixed in NUnit 3.8**. If you are experiencing this issue, please update your version of NUnit.
* Only a blank page is displayed when viewing the living documentation generated by SpecFlow+ LivingDoc in Chrome on OSX.


The following issues are known, and no fix is scheduled:

* When using **R# Build**, the test discovery process is not started for the Test Explorer. R# Build is thus incompatible and cannot be used with SpecFlow+ Runner.
