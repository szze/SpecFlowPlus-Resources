SpecFlow+ Runner provides tighter integration with the Visual Studio Test Explorer. Once you have built your solution, your tests are displayed with their business-readable scenario titles in the Test Explorer.

When running tests from the Test Explorer window, tests are executed using the following defaults.

### Profile

SpecFlow+ Runner uses [[test profiles|SpecFlowPlus-Runner-Profiles]] to configure a variety of settings that determine how tests are executed. By default, the Test Explorer uses the `VisualStudio.srprofile` file in your project, if present. If the file does not exists, the `Default.srprofile` file is used instead.

You can specify a different profile in your .runsettings file (see below).

### Processor Architecture

Unless specified otherwise in the test profile, tests are executed using the test processor architecture setting in Visual Studio. By default, this is set to `x86` in Visual Studio.

To change this setting in Visual Studio, select  **Test|Test Settings|Default Processor Architecture|** from the menu and choose the desired architecture (X86 or X64).

### Report file

By default, the name of the [[report|Reports]] generated by SpecFlow+ Runner is based on the project name and current time.

## Custom Configuration

To customise your configuration, you need to use a combination of the [Visual Studio test settings file](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj635153.aspx) and the SpecFlow+ Runner test profile. This requires the following steps:

1. Add a test settings file to your project based on the template located in `packages/SpecRun.Runner.{version}/docs/Sample.runsettings` using **Add Existing Item...** in Visual Studio.
2. Change the settings in the `.runsettings` file as needed (see below).
3. Select **Test|Test Settings|Select Test Settings** from the menu and choose your file.

### General run settings

SpecFlow+ Runner uses the following Visual Studio general settings. You can find details about these settings on [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj635153.aspx).

* `ResultsDirectory`: The directory where test results are placed.
* `TargetFrameworkVersion`: Default target framework version (to test using the .NET 3.5 framework, set the `TargetFrameworkVersion` to `Framework40` and use the SpecFlow+ Runner profile to specify .NET 3.5)
* `TargetPlatform`: Default processor architecture (can be overridden in the SpecFlow+ Runner profile)

Sample run settings file with general settings:

```xml
<RunSettings>
  <RunConfiguration>
    <ResultsDirectory>.\TestResults</ResultsDirectory>
    <TargetPlatform>x86</TargetPlatform>
    <TargetFrameworkVersion>Framework40</TargetFrameworkVersion>
  </RunConfiguration>
  ...
</RunSettings>
```

### SpecFlow+ Runner settings

SpecFlow+ Runner settings can be specified in the `<SpecRun>` element of your `.runsettings` file. See the "Execution defaults" section for information on the default settings.

Available options:

* `Profile`: Specifies the SpecFlow+ Runner [[test profile|SpecFlowPlus-Runner-Profiles]] to use. 
* `ReportFile`: Specifies the name of the report file. 
* `GenerateSpecRunTrait`: If set to `true`, all SpecFlow+ Runner tests are marked with the `SpecRun` trait. This can be useful for distinguishing SpecFlow+ Runner tests from unit tests in the Test Explorer window.
* `GenerateFeatureTrait`: If set to `true`, all SpecFlow+ Runner tests are marked with traits using the feature title. The "Group by Class" view of the Test Explorer window can also be used to group tests by feature.

Sample `.runsettings` file with SpecFlow+ Runner settings:

```xml
<RunSettings>
  <RunConfiguration>
    ...
  </RunConfiguration>

  <!-- Configurations for SpecFlow+ Runner -->
  <SpecRun>
    <Profile>MyProfile.srprofile</Profile>
    <ReportFile>CustomReport.html</ReportFile>
    <GenerateSpecRunTrait>false</GenerateSpecRunTrait>
    <GenerateFeatureTrait>false</GenerateFeatureTrait>
  </SpecRun>
</RunSettings>
```
