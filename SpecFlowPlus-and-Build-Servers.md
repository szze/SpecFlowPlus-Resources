You can set up SpecFlow+ Runner to execute your tests whenever a build is created on your build server. When running tests on a build server, use the `buildserverrun` [[command line option|SpecFlowPlus-Runner-Command-Line]].

For general information on configuring builds, refer to the vendor-specific documentation. The following sections only cover configuring the build to execute your SpecFlow+ tests, not the full configuration process:  

* [[SpecFlow+ and TFS/VSTS|SpecFlowPlus-and-TFS-VSTS]]
