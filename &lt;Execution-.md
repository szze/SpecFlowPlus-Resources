The `<Execution>` element defines how your tests are executed. The following attributes are available:

|Attribute         |Required/Optional|Description|
|------------------|-----------------|-----------|
|stopAfterFailures |Optional         |The number of failed tests after which the execution of all tests is stopped. Set this to 0 (zero) to execute all tests, irrespective of the number of failures. If not specified, this defaults to 10. **Note:** The value in the default `.srprofile` shipped with the NuGet package is 3.| 
|testSchedulingMode|Optional         |Determines the order in which SpecRun executes your tests:<br>`Sequential`: Tests are always executed in the same order (default). The order in which tests are executed is predictable and always the same, but cannot be influenced manually.<br>`Random`: The order of tests is randomised. This can be useful to detect flickering scenarios that may pass/fail depending on the order in which the other tests area executed.<br>`Adaptive`: SpecRun uses the statistics available in the pass/fail history to determine which tests to run first. Previously failing tests and new tests are executed before successful and stable tests.<br><b>Note:</b> If you set the `testSchedulingMode` to `Adaptive` when no previous test execution results are available (e.g. no server has been configured, or the server is unreachable), the tests are executed using the `Random` option instead.|
|testThreadCount  |Optional          |The number of tests threads used to execute tests (default=1). <br>While there is no maximum number of threads, setting this value too high can reduce performance as the individual threads compete for processing power. Setting the number of threads to one less that your number of cores is recommended for `Process` test thread isolation (`testThreadIsolation` setting). You can generally use higher numbers for isolation using `AppDomain` and `SharedAppDomains`.<br>**Note:** Just increasing the number of threads on its own may cause issues, e.g. if the threads access the same database. It thus makes sense to combine this with a relocation and transformation of the .config file using the `{TestThreadId}` placeholder in the name of the new file and database instances (see <DeploymentTransformation> below).<br>**Note:** Before and After hooks (e.g. BeforeTestRun, AfterTestRun etc.) are executed per thread.|
|retryFor         |Optional          |Determines which tests should be retried based on their status. Available options:<br>`None`: No tests are retried<br>`Failing`: Failing test are retried (default)<br>`All`: All tests are retried, including those that pass<br>**Note:** Tests are retried immediately after returning the corresponding status and before any subsequent tests are executed.|
|retryCount       |Optional          |The number of times tests whose execution status matches the value defined in `<retryFor>` are retried (default = 2).| 
|apartmentState   |Optional          |Sets the apartment state used to execute the tests. Possible values:<br>`STA`: Single Threaded Apartment. Use this if your application is not thread-safe<br>`MTA`: Multi-Threaded Apartment<br>`Unknown`: The ApartmentState is not set (default); tests run in same thread as SpecFlow+|
