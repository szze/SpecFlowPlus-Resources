Generating living documentation from your Gherkin files with SpecFlow+ LivingDoc requires you to add the SpecFlow+ build step to your build process. This build step parses the Gherkin files in your solution and formats them for display in VSTS. 
A default build step is included when installing the extension. **This build step only generates the documentation; it does not execute any tests or build your solution.** You will need to add an [[additional step|SpecFlowPlus-and-TFS-VSTS]] to build your solution and execute your tests.

**Note:** You do not need to use TFS to actually build your application. You can simply add a build definition that acquires the sources and generates the documentation.
