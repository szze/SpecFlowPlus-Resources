## I'm trying to run my SpecFlow+ Runner tests in Visual Studio test window, but they fail with an assembly load error

In some cases the cache folder of Visual Studio Test Adapter gets corrupted. You need to clear the cache to resolve this:

1. Close all Visual Studio instances
2. Open the folder `%TEMP%\VisualStudioTestExplorerExtensions\`
3. Delete all folders named `*SpecRun*`
