The number of scenarios in a project can grow very quickly, so finding the right feature file is important. SpecFlow+ LivingDoc allows you to search for tags and titles (features, scenarios, scenario outlines). 
To search for a feature file by feature or scenario title:  

1. Enter your search term in the **Filter** field. As you type, the results of the search are updated in the tree below.  
  ![Search](http://www.specflow.org/screenshots/Search.png)
1. Folder, feature and scenario titles containing the search term are displayed in blue. Node titles displayed in grey do not contain the search term, but at least one child or parent item title contains the search term. All other nodes (i.e. with no hits) are hidden in the tree.
1. Click on an entry in the tree to display that entry.

You can also optionally search in the contents of feature files (steps, descriptions).
To include steps and descriptions in your search:  

1. Enable **Include steps and descriptions for filtering scenarios** below the **Filter** field.
1. Enter your search term in the **Filter** field. As you type, the results of the search are updated in the tree below.
