## Switching to Related Feature Files
If your source code (feature files) is stored in a TFS/VSTS or GitHub repository, you can switch directly from the living documentation to the source feature files. You can then edit the feature files directly in TFS/VSTS or on GitHub.


To switch to a feature file:  
1. Open the corresponding page in the living documentation.
1. Click on **Show source** at the top of the page.  
  **Note:** If your feature files are stored in a source other than TFS/VSTS or GitHub, this option is not available. 
1. The corresponding source feature file in your code repository is opened. You can edit the file directly in TFS/VSTS or GitHub.

**Note:** You may need to merge any conflicts that arise from your edits.
