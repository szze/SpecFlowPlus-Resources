## Switching to Related Feature Files
You can switch from the living documentation to the source feature files stored in TFS, allowing you to edit the feature files directly in TFS/VSTS.

To switch to a feature file:  
1. Open the corresponding page in the living documentation.
1. Click on **Show source** at the top of the page.
1. The corresponding source feature file in your code repository is opened. You can edit the file directly in TFS/VSTS.

**Note:** Editing the feature files uses the standard TFS/VSTS interface, and you may need to merge any conflicts that arise from your edits.
