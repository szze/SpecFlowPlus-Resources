* Advanced test runner features: execution profiles, target environments, attach artifacts to test execution reports, TFS integration, TeamCity integration, business-readable HTML report, complex scenario filter expressions
* Dedicated support for integration test execution (config file transformation, deployment steps, test targets: re-run tests for different environments and configurations, detect flickering scenarios)
* Parallel test execution (app domain isolation, process isolation, execution results consolidation)
* Advanced test execution scheduling (run previously failing tests first, retry scenarios, execution history available as OData)
* Customisable execution reports (Razor templates)
