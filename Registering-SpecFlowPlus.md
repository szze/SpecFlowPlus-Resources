## SpecFlow+ Runner

[[Installing|SpecFlow--Runner-Installation]] SpecFlow+ Runner's NuGet packages installs SpecFlow and SpecFlow+ to the `/packages` folder of your Visual Studio solution. After installing the packages, register your license by starting SpecRun.exe (in `/packages/SpecRun.Runner.1.x.y/tools`) from the command line using the following syntax:

<code>SpecRun.exe register &lt;LicenseKey> "&lt;Licensee>"</code>

Replace the placeholders (&lt;LicenseKey>, &lt;Licensee>) in angled brackets with your license key and licensee.

<b>Note:</b> If you purchased SpecFlow+ via SWREG, the licensee is the email address you used to make the purchase and that the license key was sent to.
